Used to fill in a google form automatically that I had to fill in for class in the mornings.

usage:
    
    1.  Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download python 
    2.  Open cmd (press windows key and type cmd.exe) and type "pip install selenium" 
    3.  Download any code editor that can run python. I used VS code https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
    4.  Download geckodriver (firefox) https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases or chromedriver https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 
    5.  Copy the code into the code editor (I don't recommend this as you don't learn anything)
    6.  Change 'student id', 'passwrod', 'firstname.lastname@student.tdsb.on.ca', 'First name', and 'Last name' to your data and run the program
    7.  You're done!
