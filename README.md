Use this code to fill in a google form automatically.
The form I used in the code is a replica of a previous attendance form.

usage:
    
    1.  Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download python 
    2.  Open cmd (press windows key and type cmd.exe) and type "pip install selenium" 
    3.  Download any code editor that can run python. I used VS code https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
    4.  Download geckodriver (firefox) https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases or chromedriver https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 
    5.  Copy the code into the code editor (I don't recommend this as you don't learn anything)
    6.  Change 'student id', 'password', 'firstname.lastname@student.tdsb.on.ca', 'First name', and 'Last name' to your info and run the program
   
If you encounter a "Unable to locate element" error, add "time.sleep()" above the line with the error and re-run it.
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^ you will encounter an error here if you directly copy this code
                                                          I'll let you change it so you can actually learn (no spoonfeeding smh)
